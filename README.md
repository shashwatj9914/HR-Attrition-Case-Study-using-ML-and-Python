# HR-Attrition-Case-Study-using-Python-and-ML
### In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model using Logistic Regression to predict if the a set of employees from a mega-set of 14K+ employees will quit the job or not. 
### I drove data over Turnover Propensity Index (TPI) to classify each employess as unlikely, less likely, more likely, or most likely to quit the job.
### Finally, I concluded top 3 factors responsible for employee retention using Confusion matrix and Decision tree algorithm.
### Throughout the project, I produced various visualization charts to produce insightful results.  
### I have performed a different analysis in each and every section. After each analysis, I have presented a report summarizing all the observations of that particular section.
 
Firstly, we performed the Count Analysis of the Data in various ways like:\
#### Analysis of salary with overall data:

#### Report:
We can see that the most number of employees are under the catagory of Low Salary. Also, we can interpret that there are relatively low number of employees whose salaries are considerd HIGH. We can sense this information naturally becouse people with high salary work on higher levels ie; they manage several number of employees under them.So the intution derived from the data is right.
 
#### Analysis of Department with overall Data:

#### Report:
The insight that we gain from the above graph is that the number of employees working under the Sales department is highest. By this graph, we can know and compare workforces under different Departments.
