# HR-Attrition-Case-Study-using-ML-and-Python
 In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Logistic Regression to predict if the set of 14K+ employees will quit the job or not .
 I drove data over Turnover Propensity Index (TPI) to classify each employess as unlikely, less likely, more likely, or most likely to quit the job.
 Finally, I concluded top 3 factors responsible for employee retention using Confusion matrix and Decision tree algorithm.
 Throughout the project, I produced various visualization charts to produce insightful results.
